    "## How to create DStreams?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there're many different ways to make DStreams, but fundamentally every DStream, except for the file sream, is associated with a receiver. A reciver is the object that receives data from the source and stores it in Spark memory for processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these receivers are available directly from Sparks Streaming context API such as file systems and TCP socket connections of RDD. Other receivers that may require other dependencies including Kafka, Flume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note when specifying the number of cores that you're using with Spark it's always important to use more than one. \n",
    "\n",
    "So for the receiver available from the streaming context API, we would approach this by importing 'StreamingContext', which is the prerequesite for all Spark's streaming functionality and creating a local StreamingContext with 10 execution threads for example and a batch interval with the specified number of seconds."
